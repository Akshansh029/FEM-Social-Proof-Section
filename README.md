## My process

I decided to use grid areas to build this project but as I approached, I started to face difficulties with that so for now I've used template rows and columns. For reponsiveness, I've used media queries, min and clamp functions.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have learned that I have to practice more grid layouts in order to have a full understanding about grid layout system and specially how to use grid areas properly.
